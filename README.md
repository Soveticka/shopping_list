## Database Diagram

![Database Schema](database-diagram.drawio.png)

The database consists of 6 main tables with the following relationships:

### Core Tables
- **ðŸŸ£ users**: Authentication, user management, and Authentik OIDC integration
- **ðŸ”µ shopping_lists**: User-owned shopping lists with sharing capability
- **ðŸŸ¢ shopping_list_items**: Individual grocery items with categories and priorities
- **ðŸ”´ list_shares**: Active sharing system with read/write/admin permissions
- **ðŸŸ  notifications**: User notifications with JSONB data and read status
- **ðŸŸ¡ grocery_memory**: Autocomplete suggestions based on user shopping patterns

### Key Relationships
- **Users â†’ Shopping Lists** (1:N): Each user can own multiple shopping lists
- **Shopping Lists â†’ Items** (1:N): Each list contains multiple grocery items
- **Users â†’ Grocery Memory** (1:N): Each user has personalized autocomplete data
- **Lists â†” Users** (M:N): Active sharing via `list_shares` with permissions
- **Users â†’ Notifications** (1:N): Each user receives notifications for sharing and updates

### Database Features
- **Cascade Deletion**: Automatic cleanup when users are deleted
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` managed by triggers

### Backend Development (Go)
- Built with Go 1.23 and Gin web framework for optimal performance
- PostgreSQL database with pgx/v5 driver for high-performance database operations
- JWT authentication using golang-jwt/jwt/v5
- Bcrypt password hashing with golang.org/x/crypto
- Custom CORS middleware for frontend communication
- Comprehensive error handling, validation, and structured logging
- Automatic database migrations with table creation and indexing
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns (handlers, auth, database, config)

### Frontend Development (SvelteKit)
- SvelteKit with TypeScript for type safety and optimal performance
- Vite build system for fast development and optimized production builds
- CSS Grid/Flexbox responsive layout with utility classes
- JWT token management with automatic renewal and secure storage
- Reactive state management using Svelte stores
- RESTful API integration with proper error handling
- Modern component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- Memory leak prevention and performance optimizations

## Browser Support
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication with secure claims
- Password hashing with bcrypt and configurable cost
- Custom CORS middleware with origin validation
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries via pgx
- Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- User authorization checks for all protected resources
- Secure sharing system with permission-based access control
- OIDC integration support for enterprise authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No shopping list available"**: Usually resolved by user registration/login
2. **JWT token errors**: Check token expiration and ensure proper Authorization header format
3. **Database connection issues**: Check PostgreSQL service status and migration completion
4. **Memory leaks in frontend**: Fixed with reactive loop prevention and proper component lifecycle management
5. **CORS errors**: Verify frontend URL is in allowed origins configuration

### Debug Information
The Go backend includes structured logging for all operations. The SvelteKit frontend includes error boundaries and proper error handling. Check Docker logs for detailed error information.
