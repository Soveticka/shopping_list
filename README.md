## Architecture

### Backend (Python Flask)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper schema relationships
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for all operations
- **Security**: Password hashing with bcrypt, CORS protection

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist design with sidebar layout
- **Authentication Modals**: Registration and login forms
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic content loading via API
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with CSS Grid/Flexbox

### Database Schema
- **Users**: User accounts with authentication
- **Shopping Lists**: User-owned shopping lists
- **Shopping List Items**: Items within lists with categories and metadata
- **Grocery Memory**: Autocomplete suggestions based on user history

## Database Diagram

![Database Schema](database-diagram.drawio.png)

The database consists of 5 main tables with the following relationships:

### Core Tables
- **ðŸŸ£ users**: Authentication and user management
- **ðŸ”µ shopping_lists**: User-owned shopping lists with sharing capability
- **ðŸŸ¢ shopping_list_items**: Individual grocery items with categories and priorities
- **ðŸŸ¡ grocery_memory**: Autocomplete suggestions based on user shopping patterns
- **ðŸ”´ list_shares**: Future feature for sharing lists between users

### Key Relationships
- **Users â†’ Shopping Lists** (1:N): Each user can own multiple shopping lists
- **Shopping Lists â†’ Items** (1:N): Each list contains multiple grocery items
- **Users â†’ Grocery Memory** (1:N): Each user has personalized autocomplete data
- **Lists â†” Users** (M:N): Future sharing via `list_shares` junction table

### Database Features
- **Cascade Deletion**: Automatic cleanup when users are deleted
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `created_at` and `updated_at` managed by triggers  
- **Performance Indexes**: Optimized for common queries
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate data
- **Sample Data**: New users get example items automatically

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopping-list.git
cd shopping-list
```

2. Start the application with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Services
- **Frontend**: Nginx serving the HTML application on port 3000
- **Backend**: Python Flask API server on port 3001  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with automatic schema initialization

## Usage

### User Registration & Login
1. Open the app and click "Login" to access the authentication modal
2. New users can register with username, email, and password
3. Existing users can log in with email and password
4. New users automatically receive an example shopping list with 5 sample items

### Managing Shopping Lists
- **View Lists**: All your shopping lists are automatically loaded
- **Add Items**: Use the sidebar form to add new items with categories and priorities
- **Edit Items**: Modify quantities, mark as complete, or delete items
- **Autocomplete**: Start typing to see suggestions from your purchase history

### Sample Items for New Users
New users automatically receive a shopping list with these sample items:
- Milk (Dairy, Medium priority) - "Organic preferred"
- Bananas (Produce, Low priority) - "Not too ripe"  
- Chicken Breast (Meat, High priority) - "1 lb package"
- Bread (Bakery, Medium priority) - "Whole wheat"
- Greek Yogurt (Dairy, Low priority) - "Vanilla flavor"

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
